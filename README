  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not send anything about zmeter to

  zmeter operates by waiting for data from the digital multimeter to 
  appear on the serial port and then passing that data to a child process
  to be formatted and output.

  It takes following parameters / options:

  Serial port to open (required).
  --bytes, Print number of bytes received On/Off (optional, defaults to Off).
  --copyright, Print copyright and version information, then exit.
  --lock, Lock port On/Off (optional, defaults to On).
  --samples N, Integer Number, N, of samples to take, then exit.
    (optional, defaults to continuous (N = +Infinity).
  --timestamp, Timestamp On/Off (optional, defaults to Off).
  --verbose, Verbose, prints extra information

  See man page for details on syntax, here are a few examples...
  
  Examples:
    zmeter /dev/ttyS0
        -- opens port /dev/ttyS0
    zmeter -n /dev/ttyS1
        -- opens port /dev/ttyS1, no attempt to lock serial port
           is made
    zmeter -v /dev/ttyS2
        -- opens port /dev/ttyS2, extra output is generated
    zmeter -h
        -- displays help.           

  RC file:
    zmeter can read some options from a configuration file named
    '.zmeterrc', located in the user's home directory. The following
    options can be specified in this file:
    
      RC-file option        corresponding command line option
      ------------------    ---------------------------------
      TOTALBYTES ON/OFF     -b (--bytes)
      TIMESTAMP  ON/OFF     -t (--timestamp)
      NOLOCK     ON/OFF     -n (--nolock)

    Options provided on the command line always override the
    ones read from the rc-file.
    
    An example of rc-file with comments (zmeterrc-example) is
    included in the distribution.
   
  How to use it:
    - start zmeter on a given port
    - when you're done, stop zmeter by hitting <Ctrl + C>.
