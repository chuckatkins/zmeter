Sean Scanlon <zekat@mail.com> created zmeter as a derivitive of slsnif,
v0.4.1. Sean wishes to acknowledge Yan Gurtovoy as the author of slsnif
(Copyright (C) 2001 Yan "Warrior" Gurtovoy), and offer sincere thanks to
Yan for both developing and releasing slsnif under the GPL.

Due to the large amount of slsnif code that still remains in zmeter Sean 
felt it appropriate to leave Yan Gurtovoy's slsnif copyright information 
intact. PLEASE do NOT contact Yan Gurtovoy for support of zmeter.
Instead, please contact Sean Scanlon <zekat@mail.com> for all zmeter
comments, feature requests, issues and questions.
