                Special thanks to Yan "Warrior" Gurtovoy for releasing
                slsnif, a Serial Line Sniffer, under the GPL: zmeter 
                was derived from slnif (version 0.4.1)  much as a donut
                hole is derived from a donut: by cutting the good stuff
                out of the middle. zmeter would not have existed without
                slsnif providing the already debugged serial-port-sniffing
                code. Again, thank you Yan "Warrior" Gurtovoy.
